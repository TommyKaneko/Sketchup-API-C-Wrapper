## Ruby files
Unpack ruby files into the `third-party/ruby` folder, so as to have the folder structures below:
```
Sketchup-API-Cpp-Wrapper/third-party/ruby
            ->/include
                    ->/2.2
                    ->/2.5
                    ->/2.7
                    ->/3.2
            ->/lib
                    ->/mac
                        ->/2.2
                        ->/2.5
                        ->/2.7
                        ->/3.2
